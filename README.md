## WaterRocket_Launcher is a small project for ESP32 to build something to control a water rocket launcher.

This was originally designed for a STEM event.












## The WaterRocker is provided in three repositories.  

**WaterRocket_Launcher** contains the programming for the actual launcher, 
and will eventually contain some plans and diagrams for how the rest of the unit
was made.  So this is the base, and with just this you can do everything to pressurize
and launch.

**WaterRocket_Controller** this is a separate unit that will talk to the launcher over a
wireless protocol.  This will allow you to have some distance from the rocket and provide a
funner, kid friendly, console to look at and operate.


**WaterRocket_Payload** this device should be attached to the rocket and will record and report 
some basic telemetry.  At the very least altitude, but perhaps also acceleration, and average
speed.

Sorry, the code is not intended to be highly configurable and you are sort of on your own if you decide to use it.
